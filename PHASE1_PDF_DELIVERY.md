## 🎓 Educational Content

### Formula Examples Included

**Cell 25: Summary Statistics**

1. **Mean Formula**:
   - LaTeX notation
   - Symbol definitions (x̄, n, xᵢ, Σ)
   - Plain English explanation
   - Numerical example: House prices $150K-$190K
   - Step-by-step calculation
   - Result: Mean = $170K

2. **Standard Deviation Formula**:
   - LaTeX notation
   - Symbol definitions (σ, n, xᵢ, x̄)
   - Plain English explanation
   - Numerical example using same data
   - 4-step calculation process
   - Result: Std Dev ≈ $14,140

**Cell 27: Missing Values**

1. **Types of Missingness**:
   - MCAR (Missing Completely At Random) - with example and solution
   - MAR (Missing At Random) - with example and solution
   - MNAR (Missing Not At Random) - with example and solution

2. **Our 4-Step Strategy**:
   - Step 1: Drop columns with >50% missing
   - Step 2: Impute categorical with 'None'
   - Step 3: Impute numerical with 0/mean/median
   - Step 4: Special case (Lot Frontage) with neighborhood median

3. **Decision Rules Table**:
   - Missing >50% → DROP column
   - Missing <5% → IMPUTE safely
   - Missing 5-50% → ANALYZE carefully
